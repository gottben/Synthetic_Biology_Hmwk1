Steps to solving the homework:

1. Connect to cello via the cello API.
2. Receive the genetic circuit output from cello

3. What we actually think we have to do.

We need to identify which repressors in the circuit have the greatest effect on the score. Then from their use the functions described
in the resources for this homework to optimize the score by changing these repressors.

Questions:

Is this what we actually have to do?
If so, how do we identify these repressors?
What effect does each individual operation have on a repressor?


Tomorrow after class 2/22/2017. Meet to discuss these questions and have them answered to a certain extent.

Goal: By: 2/24/2017 have the understanding to develop a plan of attack to start coding, prior to 2 pm on friday.(ideally)

Meet at 1pm Friday to discuss then revise with Prushant.
